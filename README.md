# Mari0 2

![Picture of the game](other/pixel_tile_bug.png)

This is my fork of of the sequel prototype for Mari0. The game would combine Super Mario Bros 3 with some elements from the Portal franchise.

This fork is also a prototype, so it may undergo multiple iterations.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/BrownieO/mari0-2/wiki) to get started.

Developed for LÖVE 11.5
