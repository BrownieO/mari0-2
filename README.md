# Mari0 2

![Picture of the game](other/pixel_tile_bug.png)

This is a prototype of a sequel to Mari0. The software would combine Super Mario Bros 3 with elements from the Portal franchise.

My fork is also a prototype, so it may undergo multiple iterations. Don't use it for production.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/BrownieO/mari0-2/wiki) to get started.

Developed for LÖVE 11.5
